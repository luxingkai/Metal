     Select the system's default GPU device on which to
     run your Metal code.
     
     To use the Metal framework, you start by getting a GPU
     device. All of the objects your app needs to interact
     with Metal come from a MTLDevice that you acquire at
     runtime. iOS and tvOS devices have only one GPU that
     you access by calling MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice:
     =========================================================
     guard let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() else {
     fatalError( "Failed to get the system's default Metal device." )
     }
     =========================================================
     
     On macOS devices that are built with multiple GPUs, like
     Macbook, the system default is the discrete GPU.

    /**
     The Metal interface to a GPU that you use to draw
     graphics or do parallel computation.
     
     
     The MTLDevice protocol defines the interface to a GPU.
     You can query a MTLDevice for the unique capabilities it
     offers your Metal app, and use the MTLDevice to issue all
     of your Metal commands. Don't implement this protocol
     yourself; instead, request a GPU from the system at runtime
     using MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice in iOS or tvOS, and in
     macOS, get a list of available MTLDevice objects using
     MTLCopyAllDevicesWithObserver(handler:). See Getting the
     Default GPU for a full discussion on choosing the right GPU(s).
     
     MTLDevice objects are your go-to object to do anything
     in Metal, so all of the Metal objects your app interacts
     with come from the MTLDevice instances you acquire at
     runtime. MTLDevice-created objects are expensive but
     persistent; many of them are designed to be initialized
     once and reused through the lifetime of your app. However,
     these objects are specific to the MTLDevice that issued them.
     If you use multiple MTLDevice instances or want to switch
     from one MTLDevice to another, you need to create a separate
     set of objects for each MTLDevice.

     Creating Other Metal Objects
     
     Use the device object to create most other objects
     associated with a specific GPU.
     
     Metal represents other GPU-related entities, like compiled
     shaders, memory buffers and textures, as objects. To
     create these GPU-specific objects, you call methods on
     a MTLDevice or you call methods on objects created by a
     MTLDevice. All objects created directly or indirectly by
     a device object are usable only with that device object.
     Apps that use multiple GPUs will use multiple device
     objects and create a similar hierarchy of Metal objects for each.
